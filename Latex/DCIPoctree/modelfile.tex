\subsubsection{Model file}
This file contains the cell values of the \propertyOne ~or \propertyTwo ~model. The \propertyOne ~must have values in S/m, while \propertyTwo is often unitless. The \fileName{initial}, \fileName{reference}, and \fileName{forward} models must be in this format. Likewise, the \fileName{recovered} model files will be in this format. Model files have the following structure:
\begin{fileExample}
\begin{tabular}{|lcl|}
\hline
$\propOnegreek_{1}$ & or & $\propTwogreek_{1}$ \\
$\propOnegreek_{2}$ & or & $\propTwogreek_{2}$ \\
\vdots & & \vdots \\
$\propOnegreek_{i}$ & or & $\propTwogreek_{i}$ \\
\vdots &  & \vdots \\
$\propOnegreek_{M}$ & or &$\propTwogreek_{M}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{fileExample}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=5cm, style=sameline, align=left]
\item[\codeName{$\propOnegreek_{i}$}] \propertyOnecap ~of the $i^th$ cell. The \propertyOne ~is always in S/m. There are no a priori bound constraints set on the recovered \propertyOne model unless specific bound constraints are applied by the user.
\item[\codeName{$\propTwogreek_{i}$}] \propertyTwocap ~of the $i^th$ cell. The \propertyTwo ~is typically unitless. Since chargeability ranges between [0,1) a positivity constraint should be applied.
\item[\codeName{$M$}] The total number of cells in the octree model and its associated octree mesh.
