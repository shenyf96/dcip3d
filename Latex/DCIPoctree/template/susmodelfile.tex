\subsubsection{Model file}
This file contains the cell values of the \property ~model. The \property ~must have values in \propunits ~units. The \fileName{initial}, \fileName{reference}, and \fileName{forward} models must be in this format. Likewise, the \fileName{recovered} model files will be in this format. The following is the file structure of the model file
\begin{fileExample}
\begin{tabular}{|lc|}
\hline
$\propgreek_{1,1,1}$ & \\
$\propgreek_{1,1,2}$ & \\
\vdots & \\
$\propgreek_{1,1,NV}$ & \\
$\propgreek_{1,2,1}$ & \\
\vdots & \\
$\propgreek_{1,j,k}$ &\\
\vdots & \\
$\propgreek_{NN,NE,NV}$ & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{fileExample}
Each $\propgreek_{i,j,k}$ is \property ~at location $[i,j,k]$.

\begin{itemize}
\item[{$\propgreek_{i,j,k}$}] \propertycap ~in cell $[i, j, k]$. The \property ~is always in \propunits ~units and always positive. There are no a priori bound constraints set on recovered \property, however it is recommended that positivity condition to be enforced during the inversion.
\end{itemize}

$[i, j, k]=[1, 1, 1]$ is defined as the cell at the top, south-west corner of the model. The total number of lines in this file should equal \codeName{$NN \times NE \times NV$}, where \codeName{$NN$} is the number of cells in the north direction, \codeName{$NE$} is the number of cells in the east direction, and \codeName{$NV$} is the number of cells in the vertical direction.
